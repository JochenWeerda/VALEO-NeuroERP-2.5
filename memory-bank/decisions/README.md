## ADR-002: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Context:** Need for clear business domain boundaries

### Decision
We will implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with bounded contexts for each business domain.

### Rationale
- **Business Alignment**: Domains reflect actual business processes
- **Team Organization**: Each domain can be owned by dedicated teams
- **Scalability**: Independent domain evolution
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better business-IT alignment, team autonomy
- **Negative**: Initial complexity in domain modeling
- **Mitigation**: Domain expert involvement, iterative refinement

## ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Context:** Need for loose coupling and asynchronous processing

### Decision
We will implement Event-Driven Architecture with event sourcing for audit trails.

### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via events
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing
- **Audit Trail**: Event sourcing provides complete history
- **Resilience**: Event replay capabilities

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High scalability, complete audit trail
- **Negative**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Mitigation**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

## ADR-004: Microservice Boundaries

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Context:** Need to define service boundaries and responsibilities

### Decision
We will define microservice boundaries based on business capabilities and data ownership.

### Rationale
- **Business Capabilities**: Each service represents a business capability
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data
- **Team Boundaries**: Services align with team responsibilities
- **Technology Independence**: Services can use different technologies

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Team autonomy, technology flexibility
- **Negative**: Distributed system complexity
- **Mitigation**: Service mesh, comprehensive monitoring

## ADR-005: Testing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Context:** Need for comprehensive testing approach

### Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy with 85%+ coverage requirement.

### Rationale
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated testing prevents regressions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Confidence**: High test coverage enables safe refactoring

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High quality, safe refactoring
- **Negative**: Initial development overhead
- **Mitigation**: Test-driven development, automated test generation

## ADR-006: Security Framework

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Context:** Need for comprehensive security framework

### Decision
We will implement Zero-Trust Architecture with JWT + OAuth2 authentication.

### Rationale
- **Security**: Zero-trust approach minimizes attack surface
- **Standards**: OAuth2 is industry standard
- **Scalability**: JWT enables stateless authentication
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High security, industry standards
- **Negative**: Complex token management
- **Mitigation**: Centralized identity management, token rotation
