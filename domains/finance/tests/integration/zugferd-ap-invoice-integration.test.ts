     *
     * 1. Document arrives (PDF with embedded XML or XML file)
     * 2. processInvoiceDocument() auto-detects e-invoice format
     * 3. Routes to ZUGFeRD adapter for processing
     * 4. ZUGFeRD adapter validates and normalizes the document
     * 5. Normalized data is converted to AP invoice
     * 6. AI booking service proposes accounting entries
     * 7. Invoice is saved with full audit trail
     *
     * Key integration points:
     * - APInvoiceServiceDependencies now includes optional zugferdAdapter
     * - processInvoiceDocument() has smart routing logic
     * - processEInvoiceDocument() handles direct e-invoice processing
     * - createInvoiceFromEInvoice() converts normalized data to AP invoice
     * - Full event-driven architecture with domain events
